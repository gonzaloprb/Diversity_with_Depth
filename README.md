# Diverstiy-with-Depth

Hello Seb and Valeriano

Vertical profiles with depth. Coral-cover (Mixed-model, lmer) and PA-generic richness (MDE per island, RangemodelR)
Vertical Diversity analysis. For PA and Coral Cover using all quadrats. 
1. Beta.pair, 
2. betadisper 
3. mean of beta.pair per depth
Spatial Diversity analysis. for the three databases: PA “Jaccard”, Occupancy (Frequency) and Coral cover “Bray” 
1. Beta.pair to get b-diversity (Jac, Bray), turn and nest for the three databases
2. Check variance and homocedasticity of beta-diversity for the different depths. Betadisper (beta-diversity, group = Depths) 
3. NMDS from betadisper model and distance to median plots (for the three components)
4. Estimation of pair-wise beta-diversity per separate depths (beta.pair). boxplot of beta-diversity distances per depth and linear model of mean values with increasing depth 
5. Correlation of pair beta-diversity (jac, bray and bray) with geographical distance
