# Diverstiy-with-Depth

There is a Rmarkdown and a R script. I did not know which format you prefered. 

I am confused with the betadisper per depth. 

I can make it for all depths together, considering groups as different depths. I obtain (1) the average distance to median ("b-dissimilarity" per depth ?), (2) anova and (3)permutest pair-wise differences between (depths)

Working with all depths, either I work with the mother matrix ## 1 ##  or straight from beta.pair.abund matrix ## 2 ## 

However, making a betadisper per depth and check differences between islands is not possible. I need replicates. 

- Valeriano: you said using all quadrats per depth. However, impossible if we work with the index occupancy-frequency which is F = nb Quadrats with genus / Total nb of quadrats

- Valeriano: you said using all quadrats per depth. However, impossible if we work with the index occupancy-frequency. 


For ease, you can check the word generated from the Rmarkdown with results of the commands without running it, and the error in betadisper
