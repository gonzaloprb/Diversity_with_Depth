# Diverstiy-with-Depth

Hello Seb and Valeriano

I need your help with the betadisper function per depth (I cannot make it work, and I don't know if even possible)

The goods are the scripts inside the folder, not the Rmarkdown

the scripts do:   1) Generic richness and cover profile
                  2) NMDS
                  3) beta.pair per depth
                  4) Mantel tests.
                  5) betadisper (HERE THRE'S A PROBLEM)
                  
                  
you'll see that each analysis re-starts from the original database to make it easier for you. You can go straight to betadisper section # 290
Good to check as well the results from the other sections.

I am confused with the betadisper per different depth. 

I can make it work for all depths and sites together considering groups as different depths. I obtain (1) the average distance to median ("b-dissimilarity" per depth ?), (2) anova results and (3) permutest pair-wise differences between (depths)
Still working with all depths together, I can either work with the mother matrix ## 1 ##  or straight from beta.pair.abund matrix ## 2 ## 

However, the PROBLEM is making a BETADISPER PER DEPTH and check differences between islands. I think it is not possible as I need replicates... I obtain only 0 

- Valeriano: you said using all quadrats per depth. However, it's impossible if we work with the index occupancy-frequency which is F = nb Quadrats with genus / Total nb of quadrats. It does not work separately for all quadrats with the cover database.

You can work on any of the database (PA or Cover) and a single depth. If it works, I will do it as your solution for the rest.
